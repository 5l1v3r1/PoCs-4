[@3gstudent](https://twitter.com/3gstudent) also did a [blog post in chinese](https://3gstudent.github.io/3gstudent.github.io/Use-CLR-to-bypass-UAC/)

Dwight Hohnstein ([@djhohnstein](https://twitter.com/djhohnstein)) made a [C# implementation of this technique](https://github.com/djhohnstein/.NET-Profiler-DLL-Hijack)

A C implementation of this (as well as many other UAC bypasses) can be found in [UACME](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME) by [@hFireF0X](https://twitter.com/hFireF0X)
